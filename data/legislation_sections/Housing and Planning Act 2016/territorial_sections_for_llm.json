(3) For the effect of permission in principle, see section 70(2ZZA) to (2ZZC)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(application for technical details consent must be determined in accordance with permission in principle, except after a prescribed period). (4) A reference to permission in principle in any provision of this Act in its application to land in Wales, or in its application to functions of the Welsh Ministers or other authorities in Wales, is to be ignored. (2) After section 59 of that Act insert— 59A Development orders: permission in principle (1) A development order may either— (a) itself grant permission in principle, in relation to land in England that is allocated for development in a qualifying document (whether or not in existence when the order is made) for development of a prescribed description; or (b) provide for the granting by a local planning authority in England, on application to the authority in accordance with the provisions of the order, of permission in principle for development of a prescribed description. (2) In this section— “ prescribed ” means prescribed in a development order; “ qualifying document ” means a document, as it has effect from time to time, which— (a) falls within subsection (3), (b) indicates that the land in question is allocated for development for the purposes of this section, and (c) contains prescribed particulars in relation to the land allocated and the kind of development for which it is allocated. (3) The following documents fall within this subsection— (a) a register maintained in pursuance of regulations under section 14A of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (“ the 2004 Act ”); (b) a development plan document within the meaning of Part 2 of the 2004 Act (see section 37 of that Act); (c) a neighbourhood development plan within the meaning given by section 38A of the 2004 Act. (4) Permission in principle granted by a development order takes effect— (a) when the qualifying document takes effect, if the land in question is allocated for development in the document at that time; (b) otherwise, when the qualifying document is revised so that the land in question is allocated for development. But a development order may provide that, if the local planning authority so directs, permission in principle does not take effect until the date specified by the local planning authority in the direction. (5) For the purposes of subsection (4)(a)— (a) a register maintained in pursuance of regulations under section 14A of the 2004 Act takes effect when it is first published; (b) a development plan document takes effect when it is adopted or approved under Part 2 of the 2004 Act; (c) a neighbourhood development plan takes effect when it is made by the local planning authority.

(12) In exercising any other function exercisable by virtue of this section, or in exercising any function in relation to an application for planning permission for development of land in respect of which permission in principle has been granted, a local planning authority must have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State. (13) In relation to an application for permission in principle which under any provision of this Part is made to, or determined by, the Secretary of State instead of the local planning authority, a reference in subsection (1) or (8) to a local planning authority has effect (as necessary) as a reference to the Secretary of State. (3) In section 70 of that Act (determination of applications: general considerations)— (a) after subsection (1) insert— (1A) Where an application is made to a local planning authority for permission in principle— (a) they may grant permission in principle; or (b) they may refuse permission in principle. ; (b) after subsection (2) insert— (2ZZA) The authority must determine an application for technical details consent in accordance with the relevant permission in principle.
