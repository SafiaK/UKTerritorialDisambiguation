(3) Where a combined report is made, any reference in the inspection enactments to the publication of a report, or to the giving, or making available, to any person of a copy of a report is to be read so far as necessary as a reference to the publication of the combined report, or to the giving or making available to that person of a copy of the combined report. (4) The Chief Inspector for Wales may arrange for a combined report to be published in any manner he considers appropriate, but this subsection does not limit any duty as to publication imposed by any of the inspection enactments.
