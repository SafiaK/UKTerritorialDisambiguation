(5) The system of registration and licensing is to be administered and enforced by a person designated by the Welsh Ministers as the licensing authority for the whole of Wales or by different persons designated as licensing authorities for different areas within Wales (section 3); provision is also made for local housing authorities to exercise certain enforcement powers. (6) Sections 14 to 17 and Schedule 1 provide for a register to be established and maintained by the licensing authority and for registration generally. (7) Sections 18 to 27 provide for licences generally; and (a) a licensing authority may only grant two kinds of licence (one for landlords and the other for persons acting on behalf of landlords) and licences have effect in respect of the area for which a licensing authority is responsible (section 18); (b) in order to be licensed a person must meet certain criteria, including being a fit and proper person (section 20) and requirements relating to training (see section 19). (8) The requirements imposed by this Part are enforced by— (a) offences for contravention of registration and licensing requirements (see sections referred to in subsections (2) and (3) and sections 16(3), 23(3), 38(1) and (4) and 39(1) and (2)); (b) fixed penalty notices (section 29); (c) rent stopping orders (sections 30 and 31); (d) rent repayment orders (sections 32 and 33). (9) Sections 36 to 39 make provision about information required or given for the purposes of this Part. (10) Section 40 provides for the Welsh Ministers to issue a code of practice and provision is made for guidance (section 41) and directions (section 42). (11) Sections 43 to 48 make supplementary provision. (12) Section 49 makes further provision about interpretation and indexes the defined terms used in this Part."

(2) The amount is— (a) an amount equal to— (i) where one relevant award of universal credit was paid as mentioned in subsection (1)(b)(i), the amount included in the calculation of that award under section 11 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012, calculated in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (housing costs element for renters) ( SI 2013/376) or any corresponding provision replacing that Schedule, or the amount of the award if less, or (ii) if more than one such award was paid as mentioned in subsection (1)(b)(i), the sum of the amounts included in the calculation of those awards as referred to in sub-paragraph (i), or the sum of the amounts of those awards if less, or (b) an amount equal to the total amount of housing benefit paid as mentioned in subsection (1)(b)(ii) (as the case may be).

(7) In subsection (6)  “ relevant payments ” means— (a) in relation to an application by the licensing authority or a local housing authority (as the case may be), payments of relevant awards of universal credit, housing benefit or periodical payments payable by tenants; (b) in relation to an application by a tenant, periodical payments payable by the tenant, less— (i) where one or more relevant awards of universal credit were payable during the period in question, the amount mentioned in subsection (2)(a) in respect of the award or awards that related to the tenancy during that period, or (ii) any amount of housing benefit payable in respect of the tenancy of the dwelling during the period in question. (8) A rent repayment order may not require the payment of any amount which— (a) where the application is made by the licensing authority or a local housing authority (as the case may be), is in respect of any time falling outside the period of 12 months ending with the date of the notice of intended proceedings given under section 32(6), or (b) where the application is made by a tenant, is in respect of any time falling outside the period of 12 months ending with the date of the tenant's application under section 32(1); and the period to be taken into account under subsection (6)(a) is restricted accordingly. (9) Any amount payable by virtue of a rent repayment order is recoverable as a debt due to the licensing authority, local housing authority or tenant (as the case may be) from the appropriate person. (10) And an amount payable to the licensing authority or a local housing authority by virtue of such an order does not, when recovered by it, constitute an amount of universal credit or housing benefit (as the case may be) recovered by the authority.
