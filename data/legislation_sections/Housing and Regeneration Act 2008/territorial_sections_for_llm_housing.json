(2) But a tenancy mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) becomes a secure tenancy if the landlord notifies the tenant that it is to be regarded as a secure tenancy. (3) In this paragraph  “ a family intervention tenancy ” means, subject to sub-paragraph (4), a tenancy granted by a local housing authority in respect of a dwelling-house— (a) to a person (“ the new tenant ”) against whom a possession order under section 84 in respect of another dwelling-house— (i) has been made, in relation to a secure tenancy, on ground 2 or 2A of Part 1 of Schedule 2; (ii) could, in the opinion of the authority, have been so made in relation to such a tenancy; or (iii) could, in the opinion of the authority, have been so made if the person had had such a tenancy; and (b) for the purposes of the provision of behaviour support services. (4) A tenancy is not a family intervention tenancy for the purposes of this paragraph if the local housing authority has failed to serve a notice under sub-paragraph (5) on the new tenant before the new tenant entered into the tenancy. (5) A notice under this sub-paragraph is a notice stating— (a) the reasons for offering the tenancy to the new tenant; (b) the dwelling-house in respect of which the tenancy is to be granted; (c) the other main terms of the tenancy (including any requirements on the new tenant in respect of behaviour support services); (d) the security of tenure available under the tenancy and any loss of security of tenure which is likely to result from the new tenant agreeing to enter into the tenancy; (e) that the new tenant is not obliged to enter into the tenancy or (unless otherwise required to do so) to surrender any existing tenancy or possession of a dwelling-house; (f) any likely action by the local housing authority if the new tenant does not enter into the tenancy or surrender any existing tenancy or possession of a dwelling-house. (6) The appropriate national authority may by regulations made by statutory instrument amend sub-paragraph (5). (7) A notice under sub-paragraph (5) must contain advice to the new tenant as to how the new tenant may be able to obtain assistance in relation to the notice. (8) The appropriate national authority may by regulations made by statutory instrument make provision about the type of advice to be provided in such notices. (9) Regulations under this paragraph may contain such transitional, transitory or saving provision as the appropriate national authority considers appropriate. (10) A statutory instrument containing (whether alone or with other provision) regulations under this paragraph which amend or repeal any of paragraphs (a) to (f) of sub-paragraph (5) may not be made— (a) by the Secretary of State unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament; and (b) by the Welsh Ministers unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the National Assembly for Wales.
